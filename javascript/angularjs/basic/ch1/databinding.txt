Data binding

Data-binding in Angular apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components.
Angular provides two-way data binding, which any changes to the view are immediately reflected in the model, 
and any changes in the model are propagated to the view. The model is the single-source-of-truth in the application 
and the view (template) is a projection of the model. Because the view is just a projection of the model, 
the controller is completely separated from the view and unaware of it.
	
Data binding uses Interpolation Directive, which it inserts the result of an expression into the HTML template. YOu mark where to insert
the expression using the {{ }} notaition.
