1. Services
Angular services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection(DI). You can use
services to organize and share code across the app.

Angular services are:
	Lazily instantiated - Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
	Singletons - Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by
	the service factory.
	
Angular offers several services, such as $http.
